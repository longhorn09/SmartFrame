# Outlet installation for the Lenovo Smart Frame
Installation guide for Lenovo Smart Frame, specifically for an electrical outlet for a clean install.  
The Lenovo Smart Frame comes with an enormous power adapter that won't sit flush for any wall mounted install.  
I was unable to find a 1-gang recessed outlet that fit my specific needs, and 2-gang recessed outlets were too large.

So what I found that works is an Eaton 1210W outlet which will allow the large adapter to sit vertical in the outlet.  
Datacomm media plate is recessed, but still small enough in dimensions to be covered by the Lenovo Smart Frame itself, but deep enough so that the adapter doesn't stick out.

# Plug information
The adapter plug is roughly 2" tall by 3 1/8" long.  
And it requires 30W of power, 1.5A x 20V.

# Height and positioning
After a friend commented that the frame was too high, I did some research and found that the rule of thumb for picture hanging is the center of the picture should be around 57 to 61" from the floor. Apparently Christie's gallery standard is 1.55m which is 61". Therefore, to lower the positioning of the frame requires some spackling, sanding, and paint.

# Insulation
When carving out the cutout in the drywall to fit the recessed media outlet, you may find that the insulation is not as densely packed as you'd like for thermal and noise insulation. Or the electrician may pull out some insulationt to make fishing for cable easier. Since you have an opening in the wall, it's a rare opportunity to improve the insulation. And if you watch too many DIY videos, you start getting inspired. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eeZtMTmFFI)

## Supplies
* [Greenfiber insulation](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Greenfiber-Low-Dust-Cellulose-Blown-In-Insulation-19-lbs-INS541LD/100318635)
* [2 cup pet food scoop](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/petmate-pet-food-scoop-2-cup) 
* [5 gallon bucket](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613?)
* [5 gallon lid](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Leakproof-Lid-5GLD-ORANGE-LID-for-5GL-HOMER-PAIL/202264044?)
* [mud mixer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/ToolPro-28-in-Drywall-Mud-Mixer-with-Pail-Saver-Tip-TP03025/301284431)

You'll want a 5 gallon bucket and lid. Cut a 1" hole in the topic of the bucket.
The Greenfiber insulation is designed to be blown-in via a machine. But you can fluff it up using a drywall or paint mixing attachment.
Cut out some of the fiber and put it in the bucket, and then blend it with the drywall/paint mixing drill bit.
After it's blended, I found a 2 cup pet food scoop to be perfect for shoveling insulation into the walls.
Wear a mask and goggles when blending and filling, it'll get a little messy with lots of particles in the air.
