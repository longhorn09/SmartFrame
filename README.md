# Outlet installation for the Lenovo Smart Frame
Installation guide for Lenovo Smart Frame, specifically for an electrical outlet for a clean install.  
The Lenovo Smart Frame comes with an enormous power adapter that won't sit flush for any wall mounted install.  
I was unable to find a 1-gang recessed outlet that fit my specific needs.

So what I found that works is an Eaton 1210W outlet which will allow the large adapter to sit vertical in the outlet.  
Datacomm media plate is recessed, but still small enough in dimensions to be covered by the Lenovo Smart Frame itself, but deep enough so that the adapter doesn't stick out.

# Parts needed
* Datacomm 45-0072-WH
* Eaton 1210W (for 20A outlet)

If you happen to lose the 4 metal screws which connect the metal electrical box to the plastic media recessed mount, you can buy 4-40 3/8" screws from your nearest big box home improvement retailer.
